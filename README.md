# EventPlannerComponent

This project is a **React-based landing page** that can be reused and styled for organizations that plan events.  
It demonstrates how to structure and build a modular React component called **EventPlanner**, which is composed of multiple sections such as:

- Application description  
- Event categories  
- Features  
- Testimonials  
- Contact form  
- Footer  

Each section highlights different aspects of the Event Planner app â€” the types of events that can be planned, the app's main features, customer reviews, and ways for clients to get in touch with the service provider.

## What I Will Practiced

By working through this project, I practiced:

- Creating a **structured hierarchy of React components** to organize a landing page layout, making the code easy to maintain and extend.  
- Writing UI elements (headers, paragraphs, lists, buttons) using **JSX syntax**.  
- Implementing **dynamic content rendering** to display testimonials, event categories, and features from data sources.  
- Applying **semantic HTML markup** to improve usability and SEO.  

And, I considered the importance of **component reusability and modularity** in building scalable React applications.

## Learning Objectives

After completing this lab, I am able to:

1. Build a landing page in React using a well-organized component hierarchy.  
2. Use JSX to write clear and maintainable UI elements.  
3. Dynamically render data-driven content (testimonials, features, categories).  
4. Improve accessibility and SEO through semantic HTML usage.  
5. Apply best practices for structuring and scaling React projects.

## Tech Stack

- **React** for building the user interface  
- **JSX** for component structure and rendering  
- **HTML5 / CSS3** for layout and styling  
- **Vite** as the build tool (see `vite.config.js`)

## Future Enhancements

- Add backend integration for the contact form.
- Expand categories and testimonials from a live API.
- Improve accessibility (ARIA attributes).
- Add unit tests for components.
